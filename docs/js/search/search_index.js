Al extender alguno de\nlos subtipos Suspenseable, la misma implementación guía al desarrollador en que funciones debe reimplementar.\nEl componente padre debe definir variables para el contructor del componente y sus correspondientes parámetros.\nUso modo por defecto (no reactivo, despliega cuando termina el setup()):\n\n\n \n\n Cargando Comp...\n Falló carga de Comp\nclazzName puede ir como @Input() o como otro atributo dentro de @Input() componentParams:\ncomponentParams = { clazzName: 'CompComponent' };\nCompComponent debe extender de Suspenseable e implementar setup(), por ejemplo:\n  setup(): ObservableInput {\n    this.ngOnInit();\n    return of({\n      input: this.input,\n      otherInput: this.otherInput,\n      anotherInput: this.anotherInput\n    });\n  }Si el componente no es standalone, se le debe indicar a defaultView que el componente debe importarse desde el módulo donde se lo declara.\nEl parámetro isModule puede tomar un valor booleano o bien el nombre específico del módulo que se requiere.\nEl módulo en cuestión debe implementar SuspenseableModule.\nIMPORTANTE: Si el módulo lleva un nombre  diferente al del componente, asegurese de ser específico en el nombre del módulo para evitar errores y lograr\ndesplegar exitosamente el componente. A priori esto no debioera ser necesario ya que el componente \"sabe\" encontrar el nombre del módulo o del componente,\nsin embargo siempre es bueno estar al tanto de esto.\n Errores\nEn la mayoría de los casos los errores son bastante explicativos (favor leer los mensajes en la consola), sin embargo hay algunos\ncasos particulares que no resultan tan claros:\n\nTypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ɵcmp'): Quiere decir que no tiene una clase para poder instanciar el componente, lo que puede\npor varios motivos:\nEl nombre de la clase no corresponde al del componente de tipo Suspenseable (Ej. está mal escrito, no existe)\nEl import dinámico para obtener el contructor del componente tiene errores (Ej. apunta a otro componente/módulo)\nEn caso que el componente esté declarado en un módulo (componente no-standalone), el módulo debe declarar y exportar el componente. El módulo debe implementar\nSuspenseableModule\n\n\nErrores de compilacion en el template de un componente: Probablemente el componente de tipo Suspenseable tenga dependencias definidas en un módulo, por lo que\ndeberá indicarse isModule=true|, y el módulo debe implementar SuspenseableModule\n\nPara sacar mejor provecho de los lazy components se recomienda asegurar que el componente o su módulo asociado no esté importado en el componente padre (o su módulo),\nya que en ese caso el import se hace antes de que realmente sea necesario (pudiera haber casos donde sea válido, o necesario realizar

Se define el componente extendiendo la clase abstracta Suspenseable.\n * 2. Dependiendo de el modo de operación requerido se deberá reimplementar la función setup() o eventHandlers(). Al extender alguno de\n *    los subtipos Suspenseable, la misma implementación guía al desarrollador en que funciones debe reimplementar.\n * 3. El componente _padre_ debe definir variables para el contructor del componente y sus correspondientes parámetros.\n * 4. Uso modo por defecto (no reactivo, despliega cuando termina el setup()):\n * \n * ```\n * \n *  \n * \n *  Cargando Comp...\n *  Falló carga de Comp\n * \n * ```\n * \n * `clazzName` puede ir como @Input() o como otro atributo dentro de @Input() componentParams:\n * `componentParams = { clazzName: 'CompComponent' };`\n * CompComponent debe extender de Suspenseable e implementar setup(), por ejemplo:\n * \n * ```\n *   setup(): ObservableInput {\n *     this.ngOnInit();\n *     return of({\n *       input: this.input,\n *       otherInput: this.otherInput, \n *       anotherInput: this.anotherInput\n *     });\n *   }\n * ```\n * \n * Si el componente no es standalone, se le debe indicar a defaultView que el componente debe importarse desde el módulo donde se lo declara.\n * El parámetro isModule puede tomar un valor booleano o bien el nombre específico del módulo que se requiere.\n * El módulo en cuestión debe implementar SuspenseableModule.  \n * **IMPORTANTE**: Si el módulo lleva un nombre  diferente al del componente, asegurese de ser específico en el nombre del módulo para evitar errores y lograr \n * desplegar exitosamente el componente. A priori esto no debioera ser necesario ya que el componente *\"sabe\"* encontrar el nombre del módulo o del componente,\n * sin embargo siempre es bueno estar al tanto de esto.\n * \n * ```\n *  \n * ```\n * \n * Errores\n * ---------\n * En la mayoría de los casos los errores son bastante explicativos (favor leer los mensajes en la consola), sin embargo hay algunos \n * casos particulares que no resultan tan claros:\n * \n * - `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ɵcmp')`: Quiere decir que no tiene una clase para poder instanciar el componente, lo que puede \n *   por varios motivos:\n *   * El nombre de la clase no corresponde al del componente de tipo Suspenseable (Ej. está mal escrito, no existe)\n *   * El import dinámico para obtener el contructor del componente tiene errores (Ej. apunta a otro componente/módulo)\n *   * En caso que el componente esté declarado en un módulo (componente no-standalone), el módulo debe declarar y exportar el componente. El módulo debe implementar \n *     SuspenseableModule\n * - Errores de compilacion en el template de un componente: Probablemente el componente de tipo Suspenseable tenga dependencias definidas en un módulo, por lo que \n *   deberá indicarse isModule=true|, y el módulo debe implementar SuspenseableModule\n * \n * Para sacar mejor provecho de los lazy components se recomienda asegurar que el componente o su módulo asociado no esté importado en el componente padre (o su módulo),\n * ya que en ese caso el import se hace antes de que realmente sea necesario (pudiera haber casos donde sea válido, o necesario realizar antes la carga del módulo/componente).\n */\n@Component({\n  selector: 'suspense, [suspense]',\n  template: `\n    \n    \n  `,\n  standalone: true,\n  imports: [\n    CommonModule, \n    NgIf,\n    DefaultViewDirective, \n    FallbackViewDirective, \n    ErrorViewDirective\n  ],\n  providers: [ EventService ]\n})\nexport class SuspenseComponent {\n  /**\n   * #anchor es el template contenedor de `suspense` donde se van a desplegar ya sea\n   * el componente Suspenseable, o sus estados de \"estoy cargando\" o de error (si corresponde)\n   */\n  @ViewChild      ('anchor', { read: ViewContainerRef }) anchor: ViewContainerRef;\n\n  /**\n   * Las directivas definen las áreas del DOM donde se va a desplegar el componente que \n   * corresponda según el flujo de carga del componente Suspenseable\n   */\n  @ContentChild   (DefaultViewDirective) defaultView           : DefaultViewDirective;\n  @ContentChild   (FallbackViewDirective) fallbackView         : FallbackViewDirective;\n  @ContentChild   (ErrorViewDirective) errorView               : ErrorViewDirective;\n\n  /**\n   * Para el caso de requerir desplegar componentes Suspenseables de tipo \"no-lazy\" (ie que no se cargan dinámicamente)\n   * se hace referencia a un QueryList de ISuspenseable.

capturar.\nModo reactivo\nEl componente se despliega una vez recibido el evento :load:\n\n \n\n Cargando Comp...\n Falló carga de Comp\nEl nombre del evento debe ser el mismo que el nombre del componente SuspenseableBroadcaster, sin el sufijo \"Component\";\ny debe ser indicado como el @Input() onEvent del componente.\nSi se especifica onEvent con algún error, el componente no se desplegará y el mensaje de error indicará la corrección a realizar.\nEn este modo, una vez que el componente realice las operaciones que lo disponibilizan para ser desplegado, se deberá incluir la\ncorrespondiente llamada al método this.broadcastLoad().\nAnálogamente, en caso de error se deberá llamar al método this.broadcastError().\n\n            \n\n            \n

Muy en simple (y raptando descaradamente la definición de Suspense que trae React):\n\n lets you display a fallback until its children have finished loading.\n\nEntonces tenemos que aplicando suspense podemos, de alguna manera, asegurar que el o los componentes serán desplegados cuando efectivamente estén listos para ser desplegados. Y mientras tanto se muestra un loader (fallback).\nRequerimientos\nDe momento el único requerimiento es una versión de Angular >= v14 , ya que  utiliza componentes y directivas standalone.\nInstalación\nLa librería aún no está publicada en NPM, sin embargo se puede instalar desde el repositorio Github, referenciando directamente el paquete:\nnpm install https://github.comQuePlan/qp-suspense/releases/download/v1.0.0/qp-suspense-v1.0.0.tgz\nVersiones disponibles: https://github.com/QuePlan/qp-suspense/releases\nSuspense en Angular\nResumiendo mucho el uso de este componente, el caso de uso más simple es: \n\n  \n  \n    Cargando componente MyComponent\n  \n  \n    ERROR cargando componente MyComponent\n  \ny bajo el supuesto que el código no sea lo suficiente autoexplicativo:\n\ndefaultView : es donde se va a desplegar el componente Suspenseable. Recibe como valor el import asociado a la clase donde se ha definido el componente.\nfallbackView : es el loader que se mostrará mientras el componente efectivamente se carga.\nerrorView : es el componente que se va a desplegar en caso de presentarse errores en la carga del componente.\n\nSi se desea minimizar el LCP reservando el espacio para el componente, se puede utilizar un elemento HTML, con estilos o clases CSS; y usar suspense como una\ndirectiva de tipo atributo:\n\n  \n\n  \n    Fetching Users...\n  \nCasos de uso\n\nComponentes cargados de manera lazy.\nComponentes definidos dentro de un módulo, cargados de manera lazy.\nComponentes cuya carga está definida por marcas de estado setupReady y  hasError.\nComponentes que informan su estado de cargado o error a través de un  evento.\nComponentes que son cargados de manera no-lazy.\n\nEn todos los casos, los componentes deben estar definidos como alguna variedad de Suspenseable, y según sea la clase que extienden, serán los métodos que van a requerir implementar (los subtipos + OOP se encargan de esa magia).\nPara mayor información se recomienda ejecutar el proyecto de ejemplo:\nnpm start -- --configuration=development --project qp-suspense-demo --o\nEl detalle cada caso supuestamente está bien documentado.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         comparación de resultados \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No hay resultados que coincidan \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
